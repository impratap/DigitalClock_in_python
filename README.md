# DigitalClock_in_python

This is a project for creating a Digital Clock...

For This I used some necessary library like...

from tkinter import Label, Tk 
import time

Tkinter for the use of GUI, the Time for getting the current time and Label for display boxes where we can place text and image.

After importing the necessary library created the object of Tkinter and define some basic things like title, geometry, text_font, background, foreground, border_size etc.

Then used label widget to display box where we will place text and image which will show the Current Time.

And at last created a function to display the current time using time.strftime function.
