# DigitalClock_in_python

A Digital clock Project, in this project I have used the Tkinter library for GUI and Time library. First of all, I have created a title, geometry, icon bitmap, text font, background and foreground color, and border width. After that combine all of these into the label widget. And at last, created a function that used the strftime() method and called it.

## AIM: 
Aim of this project is to create a simple digital clock with less amount of code with the help of Tkinter to make it look super good for the user.

## LIbraries

For This I used some necessary library like...

* Tkinter
* Label
* Tk 
* Time

Tkinter for the use of GUI, the Time for getting the current time and Label for display boxes where we can place text and image.

After importing the necessary library created the object of Tkinter and define some basic things like title, geometry, text_font, background, foreground, border_size etc.

Then used label widget to display box where we will place text and image which will show the Current Time.

And at last created a function to display the current time using time.strftime function.
